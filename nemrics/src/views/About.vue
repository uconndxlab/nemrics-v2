<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>The New England Maritime Research and Innovation Capabilities Study (NEMRICS) is developing a prototype repository to display and promote the use of maritime research equipment, infrastructure, and capability owned and operated by academic, industry, and government partners throughout the New England region relevant to the undersea technology ecosystem. The intent is to create a current, searchable, usable database for researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs in academia, industry, and government to leverage the incredible technology available in our region without duplicating investment in expensive equipment or infrastructure.</p>
<h2>How to Use</h2>
<h3>Searching</h3>
<p>The NEMRICS product includes a robust, AI-driven search mechanism which allows you to search, free-form, for the capabilities you would like access to. You can use the text input on the homepage or within the global sidebar throughout the website to search for capabilities.</p>
<h3>Browsing by Organization</h3>
<p>Capabilities are organized by Provider. Using the global sidebar found throughout the website, you can select an institution and browse their offerings.</p>
<h3>Browsing by Tag</h3>
<p>Capabilities are "tagged" based on the type of offering. The global sidebar found throughout the website includes a tag cloud representing the most common tags.</p>
